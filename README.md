Bye-Rounds
==========

Great plugin. I have a problem where I want to insert a bye round which is given 4 points. Can this be done? I tried inserting it in the +/- column but the ladder does not update from highest total points to lowest. Any ideas please. I will stress, I'm quite new to this so not too familiar with coding.
